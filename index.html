     <p>Ricardo studied Communications: specialization in Digital Media in Rotterdam (next to his place of birth Vlaardingen). He has some years of experience as an online/digital marketeer at several companies. He has evolved in several disciplines within online marketing and can't wait to start with the Growth Tribe Academy.</p>

	<p>In his spare time he likes to be near his girlfriend and his son. He loves to be outside with them. He is kind of a family man and likes to spend time with his family and parents. That is why he is quite a lot on the road to visit them, especially since he became a father. If there is some time left, he loves to play football, snowboarding and he likes a good city trip.</p>
