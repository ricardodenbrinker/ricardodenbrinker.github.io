     <p>Ricardo studied Communications: specialization in Digital Media in Rotterdam (next to his place of birth Vlaardingen). He has some years of experience as an online/digital marketeer at several companies. He has evolved in several disciplines within online marketing and can't wait to start with the Growth Tribe Academy to learn how to get results quickly and to double our leads! I am especially interested in a specialization in a subject I don't know yet!</p>

	<p>In his spare time he likes to be near his girlfriend and his son. He loves to be outside with them. He is kind of a family man and likes to spend time with his family and parents. That is why he is quite a lot on the road to visit them, especially since he became a father. If there is some time left, he loves to play football, snowboarding and he likes a good city trip.</p>
